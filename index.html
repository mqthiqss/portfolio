                            <p class="card-text">My name is Mathias Culot and I am a twenty year old student at HELHa,
                                where I'm pursuing a degree in
                                Industrial IT. I've always been passionate about new technologies. I chose these
                                studies because I think that thanks to the field of computing, we'll soon be
                                making the greatest advances. <br><br>

                                I'm someone who likes to get things done early, always taking the first
                                step to solve problems or tasks. Whether it's starting a new project or finding ways to
                                make things better, being proactive helps me stay on top of things. If I'm asked to
                                complete a task in a two-week period, I know that I'll feel better if I start doing
                                it straight away. That way, I won't be surprised when I receive other, more urgent
                                tasks.<br><br>

                                I'm good at being diplomatic, which means I try to be careful and polite when I
                                talk to people. I think about how others feel and what they think, I always try to make
                                communication
                                smoother and more positive. <br><br>

                                Patience is another thing I'm proud of. I stay calm and thoughtful when things get
                                tricky, whether I'm helping someone learn or dealing with a problem. For example, I
                                remember my C programming exam in 1st year. The instructions were really hard and I could hear
                                all my classmates stressing and trying several solutions directly on the
                                coding programme. Personally, I decided to calm down and take a sheet of paper to
                                analyse the statement first and then, once I thought I'd found the solution, I started
                                typing my code. This method saved me a lot of time and I passed the exam. <br><br>

                                I'm a talkative person, and I like to chat and share ideas with others. It brings energy
                                and fun to different situations. <br><br>

                                Yet, like everyone, I have my not-so-great parts. I like to stick to a plan and have a
                                fixed schedule for work. While it helps me stay organised, I'm also learning to be more
                                flexible. For an example, one of the things I perhaps didn't like about my second-year
                                project was that we were totally free in terms of our progress. We only had a deadline
                                where everything had to be finished, but there were no regular reports to hand in or
                                anything like that. This was an added source of stress because I had no way of making
                                sure we were on schedule. <br><br>

                                Sometimes, I find it hard to stay focused. For example, when I'm coding a program I
                                might wonder about its efficiency, look to see if there are any other solutions and end
                                up getting lost in the language documentation. I know this, and I'm working on a plan to
                                get better at concentrating and staying productive.

                            <h5 class="card-title">My Experience</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">In my second year of studies, I embarked on a full-stack
                                project. This project involved the automation of an industrial process, which I found
                                both
                                very enlightening. Our task was to develop a website interfacing with an Arduino
                                embedded system,
                                measuring the speed of a passing brick on a conveyor. This
                                demanded a combination of software development, hardware integration, and data analysis
                                skills. <br> <br>

                                The most difficult part was the embedded system, where I worked on prototyping and
                                accurately
                                displaying measurements on a screen and the website, also implementing a calibration
                                process. The
                                calibration process consisted of doing measures over and over while adjusting the
                                sensors sensitivity.
                                <br> <br>

                                We only had seven days available at school, so we also had to work at the house. Working
                                remotely
                                was difficult because we had limited access to the conveyor and sensors, putting us
                                behind schedule. However, I made up for lost time by fixing all the issues with the
                                website at home so that we had
                                more time at school to work on the embedded system. <br> <br>

                                Despite stress, the project was rewarding. I navigated unknown errors, developed my
                                skills, and
                                thanks to the independence encouraged by our teachers, the accomplishment of this
                                project felt truly
                                satisfying. I also sharpened my
                                ability to effectively share ideas and collaborate with peers and mentors, recognizing
                                the significance of clear and concise communication.

                                I'm also going to do a work placement at Sonaca, a company that makes various parts of
                                aircraft wings in Gosselies. My role will be to fully develop a non-conformance
                                management application. I'll have to develop this application using the Mendix low-code
                                surface and I'll also have to use my knowledge of Java. <br> <br>

                                IT. Firstly, I am skilled in web networks,
                                I can easily set, configure, and maintain networks. This expertise allows me to
                                create and maintain robust web networks. I'm also able to use several protocols to
                                deploy
                                networks quickly. I'm familiar with protocols such as DHCP, which automatically assigns
                                valid IP addresses to all devices on a network. <br> <br>

                                Moreover, I am comfortable with C and C++ programming languages, essential for
                                developing
                                efficient softwares. These skills enable me to create low-level code
                                for specialized industrial applications. My experience with C++ has enabled me to create
                                a
                                lot of embedded system programmes, for example. <br> <br>

                                Also, my expertise in Java programming allow me to develop cross-platform
                                applications and web solutions, crucial in today's interconnected world. <br> <br>

                                In addition, I know how to make scripts on Linux thanks to the Bash programming language
                                that I've used throughout my studies. This language is very useful for automating
                                redundant tasks as part of system administration.<br> <br>

                                However, my skills are not limited to mastering a few programming languages. I'm able to
                                create and manage databases, making sure that the data is easily accessible. I'm also
                                fairly comfortable with embedded systems. I've often had to work with electricity,
                                sensors and actuators, so my knowledge isn't limited to software.<br> <br>

                                I've also had several courses on PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), and in
                                particular I've learnt to develop using
                                'Ladder Logic', which is a graphical programming language used by many PLCs.<br> <br>

                                I also used docker a lot in 2nd and 3rd year. Docker is a lightweight virtualisation
                                platform for creating and deploying applications in containers. Containers encapsulate
                                applications and their dependencies. This ensures portability and consistency of
                                execution between environments. This simplifies deployment and facilitates collaboration
                                between teams. <br> <br>

                                Finally, I bring valuable experience in system administration, involving the
                                management and maintenance of computer systems and networks to ensure their stability
                                and security.

                            <p class="card-text">Video games have always been a significant part of my life, offering
                                immersive worlds, strategic challenges, and a sense of adventure. I've always found it
                                fascinating how video games allow us to escape from our everyday lives and take our
                                minds off things. It's the media that I've used the most in my life and that I've grown
                                up with. I've also seen it evolve since I was born and I think the influence of video
                                games will keep growing. <br> <br>

                                Exploring the latest in new technology is another fascination of mine; I'm always
                                staying up to date with the latest gadgets, software, and innovations. Whether it's a
                                new smartphone or an artificial intelligence, I always love to discover new
                                technologies. <br> <br>

                                I also practised Thai boxing for 3 years. This sport has given me a lot of benefits. At
                                the time, I wasn't satisfied with my physical condition and it helped me to lose a few
                                kilos and regain good flexibility. It also gave me a sense of discipline: I had a
                                schedule to stick to and I tried to set myself new goals at each class. Of course, when
                                I didn't keep to the schedule my coach loved to come up with sadistic punishments. So I
                                had to stick to it. Finally, the boost to self-confidence that a combat sport like this
                                brings is not negligible. The simple fact of knowing you're capable of defending
                                yourself greatly boosts your self-esteem. I often think about starting my training
                                again, but unfortunately my current schedule doesn't allow me to. I'm also afraid of the
                                coach's punishment when he sees me again. <br> <br>

                                Additionally, music plays a crucial role in my life. I enjoy discovering new genres and
                                attending live concerts. The last concert I attented was performed by Damso at Palais 12
                                in Brussels. I love the way singers can communicate emotions through their art. I
                                believe that good music is not music that respects this or that code, but music that
                                makes you feel something. <br> <br>

                            <p class="card-text">I started my education at Collège du Sacré-Cœur de Charleroi, where I
                                gained a strong foundation and learned the importance of curiosity and knowledge. The
                                teachers and supportive environment there played a big role in shaping my academic
                                discipline. <br> <br>

                                Later, I moved on to HELHa, specializing in Industrial IT. HELHa focuses not just on
                                theory but also on practical applications, preparing me for real-world challenges in the
                                industry. <br> <br>

                                The community at HELHa, including teachers and peers, creates a lively learning
                                atmosphere. Working on projects together and sharing experiences has made my time here
                                worthy.
